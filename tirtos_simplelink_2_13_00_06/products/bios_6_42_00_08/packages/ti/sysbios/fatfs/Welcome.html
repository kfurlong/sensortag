            <p>FatFs is an open source FAT file system and has been ported to
               run with the SYS/BIOS operating system.</p>
            <p>Currently, the SYS/BIOS implementation of FatFs supports file I/O
               for a RAM disk.</p>

            <h1>Getting Started</h1>
            <form>
                <p>To configure FatFS, use the <a>Basic</a> and <a>Advanced</a> views.
                Most useful properties can be set from within the <a>Basic</a> view;
                while the <a>Advanced</a> view may contain some properties that aren't seen in the <a>Basic</a> view.</p>

                <li style='text' value='1.'><b>Basic.</b>  This view includes all of the configuration settings that most users will need.</li>
                <li style='text' value='2.'><b>Advanced.</b>  This view always includes every configuration setting in a generic table format.</li>
                <p>Note that you may freely move between the different views, and selecting options in one view will immediately update the
                other views' settings. You may return to the initial home view at any time by clicking on the Home icon in the upper right
                corner of the config tool window. Note that various warnings about your configuration may appear in the CCS Problems window.
                If this window is not visible, you can make it so by selecting Window->Show View->Problems.</p>
            </form>
