 *  ======== Task ========
 *  Task Manager.
 *
 *  The Task module makes available a set of functions that manipulate task
 *  objects accessed through pointers of type {@link #Handle}. Tasks represent
 *  independent threads of control that conceptually execute functions in
 *  parallel within a single C program; in reality, concurrency is achieved
 *  by switching the processor from one task to another.
 *
 *  When you create a task, it is provided with its own run-time stack,
 *  used for storing local variables as well as for further nesting of
 *  function calls. Each stack must be large enough to handle normal
 *  subroutine calls and one task preemption context.
 *  A task preemption context is the context that gets saved when one task
 *  preempts another as a result of an interrupt thread readying
 *  a higher-priority task.
 *
 *  All tasks executing within a single program share a common set of
 *  global variables, accessed according to the standard rules of scope
 *  defined for C functions.
 *
 *  Each task is in one of five modes of execution at any point in time:
 *  running, ready, blocked, terminated, or inactive. By design, there is
 *  always one
 *  (and only one) task currently running, even if it is only the idle task
 *  managed internally by Task. The current task can be suspended from
 *  execution by calling certain Task functions, as well as functions
 *  provided by other modules like the Semaphore or Event Modules.
 *  The current task
 *  can also terminate its own execution. In either case, the processor
 *  is switched to the highest priority task that is ready to run.
 *
 *  You can assign numeric priorities to tasks. Tasks are
 *  readied for execution in strict priority order; tasks of the same
 *  priority are scheduled on a first-come, first-served basis.
 *  The priority of the currently running task is never lower
 *  than the priority of any ready task. Conversely, the running task
 *  is preempted and re-scheduled for execution whenever there exists
 *  some ready task of higher priority.
 *
 *  @a(Task Deletion)
 *
 *  Any dynamically created task that is not in the Task_Mode_RUNNING
 *  state (ie not the currently running task) can be deleted using the
 *  {@link #delete} API.
 *
 *  Task_delete() removes the task from all internal queues and calls
 *  Memory_free() is used to free the task object and its stack.
 *  Memory_free() must acquire a lock to the memory before proceeding.
 *  If another task already holds a lock to the memory, then the thread
 *  performing the delete will be blocked until the memory is unlocked.
 *
 *  Note:
 *  Task_delete() should be called with extreme care.
 *  As mentioned above, the scope of Task_delete() is limited to
 *  freeing the Task object itself, freeing the task's stack memory
 *  if it was allocated at create time, and removing the task from
 *  any SYS/BIOS-internal state structures.
 *
 *  SYS/BIOS does not keep track of any resources the task may have
 *  acquired or used during its lifetime.
 *
 *  It is the application's responsibility to guarantee the integrity
 *  of a task's partnerships prior to deleting that task.
 *
 *  For example, if a task has obtained exclusive access to a resource,
 *  deleting that task will make the resource forever unavailable.
 *
 *  Task_delete() sets the referenced task handle to NULL. Any subsequent
 *  call to a Task instance API using that null task handle will behave
 *  unpredictably and will usually result in an application crash.
 *
 *  Assuming a task completely cleans up after itself prior to calling
 *  Task_exit() (or falling through the the bottom of the task
 *  function), it is then safest to use Task_delete() only when a task
 *  is in the 'Task_Mode_TERMINATED' state.
 *
 *  Delete hooks:
 *  You can specify application-wide Delete hook functions that
 *  run whenever a task is deleted. See the discussion of Hook Functions
 *  below for details.
 *
 *  Task_delete() constraints:
 *  @p(blist)
 *  -The task cannot be the currently executing task (Task_self()).
 *  -Task_delete cannot be called from a Swi or Hwi.
 *  -No check is performed to prevent Task_delete from being used on a
 *  statically-created object. If a program attempts to delete a task object
 *  that was created statically, the Memory_free() call will result in an
 *  assertion failure in its corresponding Heap manager, causing the
 *  application to exit.
 *  @p
 *
 *  @a(Stack Alignment)
 *
 *  Stack size parameters for both static and dynamic tasks are rounded
 *  up to the nearest integer multiple of a target-specific alignment
 *  requirement.
 *
 *  In the case of Task's which are created with a user-provided stack,
 *  both the base address and the stackSize are aligned. The base address
 *  is increased to the nearest aligned address. The stack size is decreased
 *  accordingly and then rounded down to the nearest integer multiple of the
 *  target-specific required alignment.

 *  <a name="hookfunc"></a>

 *
 *  @a(Hook Functions)
 *
 *  Sets of hook functions can be specified for the Task module.  Each
 *  set can contains these hook functions:
 *  @p(blist)
 *  -Register: A function called before any statically created tasks
 *      are initialized at runtime.  The register hook is called at boot time
 *      before main() and before interrupts are enabled.
 *  -Create: A function that is called when a task is created.
 *      This includes tasks that are created statically and those
 *      created dynamically using {@link #create} or {@link #construct}.
 *      The create hook is called outside of a Task_disable/enable block and
 *   before the task has been added to the ready list.
 *  -Ready: A function that is called when a task becomes ready to run.
 *   The ready hook is called from within a Task_disable/enable block with
 *   interrupts enabled.
 *  -Switch: A function that is called just before a task switch
 *      occurs. The 'prev' and 'next' task handles are passed to the Switch
 *      hook. 'prev' is set to NULL for the initial task switch that occurs
 *      during SYS/BIOS startup.  The Switch hook is called from within a
 *      Task_disable/enable block with interrupts enabled.
 *  -Exit:      A function that is called when a task exits using
 *      {@link #exit}.  The exit hook is passed the handle of the exiting
 *      task.  The exit hook is called outside of a Task_disable/enable block
 *      and before the task has been removed from the kernel lists.
 *  -Delete: A function that is called when any task is deleted at
 *      run-time with {@link #delete}.  The delete hook is called outside
 *      of a Task_disable/enable block.
 *  @p
 *  Hook functions can only be configured statically.
 *
 *  If you define more than one set of hook functions, all the functions
 *  of a particular type will be run when a Swi triggers that type of
 *  hook.
 *
 *  @p(html)
 *  <B>Register Function</B>
 *  @p
 *
 *  The Register function is provided to allow a hook set to store its
 *  hookset ID.  This id can be passed to {@link #setHookContext} and
 *  {@link #getHookContext} to set or get hookset-specific context.  The
 *  Register function must be specified if the hook implementation
 *  needs to use {@link #setHookContext} or {@link #getHookContext}.
 *  The registerFxn hook function is called during system initialization
 *  before interrupts have been enabled.
 *
 *  @p(code)
 *  Void myRegisterFxn(Int id);
 *  @p
 *
 *  @p(html)
 *  <B>Create and Delete Functions</B>
 *  @p
 *
 *  The create and delete functions are called whenever a Task is created
 *  or deleted.  They are called with interrupts enabled (unless called
 *  at boot time or from main()).
 *
 *  @p(code)
 *  Void myCreateFxn(Task_Handle task, Error_Block *eb);
 *  @p
 *
 *  @p(code)
 *  Void myDeleteFxn(Task_Handle task);
 *  @p
 *
 *  @p(html)
 *  <B>Switch Function</B>
 *  @p
 *
 *  If a switch function is specified, it is invoked just before the new task
 *  is switched to.  The switch function is called with interrupts enabled.
 *
 *  This function can be used to save/restore additional task context (for
 *  example, external hardware registers), to check for task stack overflow,
 *  to monitor the time used by each task, etc.
 *
 *  @p(code)
 *  Void mySwitchFxn(Task_Handle prev, Task_Handle next);
 *  @p
 *
 *  To properly handle the switch to the first task your switchFxn should
 *  check for "prev == NULL" before using prev:
 *
 *  @p(code)
 *  Void mySwitchFxn(Task_Handle prev, Task_Handle next)
 *  {
 *      if (prev != NULL) {
 *          ...
 *      }
 *      ...
 *  }
 *  @p
 *
 *  @p(html)
 *  <B>Ready Function</B>
 *  @p
 *
 *  If a ready function is specified, it is invoked whenever a task is made
 *  ready to run.   The ready function is called  with interrupts enabled
 *  (unless called at boot time or from main()).
 *
 *  @p(code)
 *  Void myReadyFxn(Task_Handle task);
 *  @p
 *
 *  @p(html)
 *  <B>Exit Function</B>
 *  @p
 *
 *  If an exit function is specified, it is invoked when a task exits (via
 *  call to Task_exit() or when a task returns from its' main function).
 *  The Exit Function is called with interrupts enabled.
 *
 *  @p(code)
 *  Void myExitFxn(Task_Handle task);
 *  @p

     *  -Create: A function that is called when a task is created.
     *  This includes tasks that are created statically and those
     *  created dynamically using {@link #create} or {@link #construct}.

     *  -Ready: A function that is called when a task becomes ready to run.
     *   The ready hook is called from within a Task_disable/enable block with
     *   interrupts enabled.
     *  -Switch: A function that is called just before a task switch
     *  occurs. The 'prev' and 'next' task handles are passed to the Switch
     *  hook. 'prev' is set to NULL for the initial task switch that occurs
     *  during SYS/BIOS startup.  The Switch hook is called from within a
     *  Task_disable/enable block with interrupts enabled.
     *  -Exit:  A function that is called when a task exits using
     *  {@link #exit}.  The exit hook is passed the handle of the exiting
     *  task.  The exit hook is called outside of a Task_disable/enable block
     *  and before the task has been removed from the kernel lists.
     *  -Delete: A function that is called when any task is deleted at
     *  run-time with {@link #delete}.  The delete hook is called outside
     *  of a Task_disable/enable block.
