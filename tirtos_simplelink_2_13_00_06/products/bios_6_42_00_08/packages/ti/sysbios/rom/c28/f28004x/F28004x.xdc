 *  These proxy bindings are fixed in ROM:
 *
 *   ti.sysbios.BIOS.RtsGateProxy is fixed and bound to GateMutex (non-issue for IAR and GNU)
 *   ti.sysbios.hal.Timer.TimerProxy is fixed and bound to c28.Timer.
 *   ti.sysbios.hal.Hwi.HwiProxy is fixed and bound to c28.Hwi.
 *   ti.sysbios.heaps.HeapMem.Module_GateProxy is fixed and bound to GateMutex
 *   ti.sysbios.knl.Clock.TimerProxy is fixed and bound to f28004x.Timer.
 *   ti.sysbios.knl.Task.SupportProxy is fixed and bound to c28.TaskSupport.
 *   xdc.runtime.Memory_HeapProxy is fixed and bound to HeapMem.
 *   xdc.runtime.System_Module_GateProxy is fixed and bound to GateHwi
 *   xdc.runtime.Timestamp.SupportProxy is fixed and bound to f28004x.Timestamp 

 *  These proxy bindings are configurable:
 *
 *   System.SupportProxy is configurable.
 *
 *  This module's C file (F28004x.c) will not be included in the 
 *  string returned by Build.getCFiles() because the 
 *  ti.sysbios.rom.c28.f28004x package is deliberately not
 *  included in the "Build.biosPackages[]" table.
