 *  ======== MultithreadSupport ========
 *  This Multithread support module uses Hook Functions, Hook Context
 *  and an overloaded implementation of the library's lock and thread
 *  local storage access functions to make C runtime library calls re-entrant.
 *
 *  Multithread support will be enabled when IAR linker option "--threaded_lib"
 *  is passed as the target's linker options prefix. This can be done in one
 *  of the following ways:
 *     - When building an application in IAR Embedded Workbench, under
 *       Project -> Options -> General Options -> Library Configuration,
 *       check the "Enable thread support in Library" box.
 *     - When building an application through makefile using configuro, pass
 *       the linker options on configuro command line using "--linkOptions"
 *       option.
 *     - When building an application through XDC build system using config.bld,
 *       pass the linker options through the XDC target linkOpts.prefix in
 *       config.bld.
 *
 *  Note: Calling C runtime functions from SWI and HWI threads
 *        is not supported and will generate an exception if
 *        multithread support is enabled.
