The UIA Hello World Example
---------------------------
Overview: The Log_info0 macro is used to log string constant ("Hello World!)
  that can be viewed using System Analyzer.

How to run:
   1. Launch a debug session for the target device the project was built for
   2. Load the project into the target and run to main
   3. In CCS, open the Debug Perspective and, from the Tools menu, select
      System Analyer (see the tutorial link below for step-by-step
	  instructions on how to do this)
   4. Run the project until it exits

Expected output:
   You should see an event with the message "Hello World!" in
   System Analyzer's Log View.
