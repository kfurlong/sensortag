These files were generated using the USB desciprtor tool.
The .dat files are the saved files by the descriptor tool so we can easily
generate the files in the examples' ./*/USB_config folders.

For example:
cdc.dat generates the descriptor files to be placed into the USB_Config/
folder for the MSP430 CDC project.

The CDC Logging example uses the same descriptors as USB CDC
